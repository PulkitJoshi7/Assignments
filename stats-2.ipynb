    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Scale: Covariance is not standardized and can take on any value. Its value is influenced by the scales of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range of covariance is not bounded, which means it can take both positive and negative values. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship (variables tend to increase or decrease together), while a negative covariance indicates a negative relationship (one variable tends to increase as the other decreases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Units: The units of covariance are the product of the units of the two variables. This can make it difficult to compare covariance across different datasets with different scales.\n",

    "Definition: Correlation also measures the relationship between two variables, but it specifically quantifies the strength and direction of a linear relationship. It indicates how well the change in one variable can be predicted by the change in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardized: Correlation is a standardized measure, meaning it's scaled to a range between -1 and 1, regardless of the units of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range of correlation is bounded between -1 (perfect negative correlation) and 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no linear correlation.\n",
